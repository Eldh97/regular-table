## Feature Request

### Description of Problem:
What *problem* are you trying to solve that the project doesn't currently solve?

Please resist the temptation to describe your request in terms of a solution.  Job Story form ("When [triggering condition], I want to [motivation/goal], so I can [outcome].") can help ensure you're expressing a problem statement.

### Potential Solutions:
Clearly and concisely describe what you want to happen. Add any considered drawbacks.

If you've considered alternatives, clearly and concisely describe those too.
